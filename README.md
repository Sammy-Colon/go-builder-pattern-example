# Builder Pattern in Golang

This repository shows an example implementation for the builder pattern in Go.

The boilerplate code can be generated by my Visual Studio Code extension: **Go Builder Pattern Boilerplate**. It is available in the [VSC Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SammyColon.go-builder-pattern-boilerplate) and [VSCodium Marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/SammyColon/go-builder-pattern-boilerplate). The source code is available here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sammy-Colon/go-builder-pattern-boilerplate). A blog post with a detailed explanation, can be read here on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sammy_colon/golang-builder-pattern-the-easy-way-ad3eebedd390).

## Explanation

You create your struct (`Config` in this example). You need to create an `Option` type (`ConfigOption` in this example), which is a function that receives and returns your struct. For every field of your struct, you can create a function (usually called `With<Field>`) that modifies the respective field and returns the modified struct.

You can also create a function for creating a default config (`CreateDefaultConfig` in this example and typically called `CreateDefault<Struct>`). Finally, you need to create the function that builds your struct (usually called `Create<Struct>`). It first initializes an empty struct or creates it with default values. Then it iterates through the given options, which are iteratively modifying the struct.

You are now able to create your struct by calling `Create<Struct>` with the available options (`With<Field>`) as the input!
